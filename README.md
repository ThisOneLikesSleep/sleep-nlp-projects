Collection of NLP algorithms I've coded from scratch.
  - BERT_classification.py: Using BERT, trains a model to classify Netflix reviews into a 5 star review score and saves the best model as a .pt file.
  - BoW.py: Converts news articles into bags of words then classifies them into different categories using KNN.
  - K_means.py: Uses K-means to convert different mall customers into clusters.
  - text_classification.py: Converts news articles into tf-idf matrices, then uses KNN to classify them into different news categories.
  - tf_idf_pyTorch.py: Converts text into tf-idf matrices, applies PCA and uses neural network to classify them into categories.
  - tf_idf_with_library.py: Basically text_classification.py but using sklearn's TfidfVectorizer rather than coding from scratch as well as calculating the ROC curve.
